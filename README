this code has two applications the python/quixote server kmerBrowser.pyand the processing kMerBriwserInterface.pde projectyou have to set the server for quixote to the same address KBI usesmake all your files you want to consume screed repositories, it is possible that the current codetries to load more files then you actually have, update line 26 in kmerbrowser.py accordinglyfor the processing project you have to include all pde files in the same project and also createa font called : ArialRoundedMTBold-20 which is saved in the data file of the project, it ispossible that you have to redo this step when compiling for the first timein kmerbrowserinterface you have to use depth to set the radiusand also make sure the startingKmer (line 11) has the right length and existsyou control kmerbrowserinterface with the mouse, scrollwheel to zoom, . , to increaseor decrease the radius, click and drab besides the graph allows to move the screen, press t if you want to toggle the text on/off (increases rendering speed), click a nodeso that it becomes blue and click GO to make this node the new center of the graphexercise caution when using low k or highly tangled graphs together with a high radius, since thatmightoverload the graph and you end up freezing both apps.Cheers Arend
